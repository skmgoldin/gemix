# Gemix Server

Gemix server is a mixing service server for JobCoin. It takes three arguments: a port, a scan interval (the duration, in seconds, between scans of the JobCoin API), and a house address.

Example:
```
node index.js --port 3000 --scanInterval 1 --houseAddr abcdwxyz
Gemix server running on port 3000
```
